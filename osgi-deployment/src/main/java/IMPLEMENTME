Here are the constraints:

- do not touch any of the app, domain or infra layers, these must
  remain unaware of their deployment (so no blueprint files there!)
- you can use any combination of the infra layers. If you can support
  all of them with minimal changes to this deployment, bonus points
- write an integration test on the REST layer that results in 100% code
  coverage in all used layers (app, domain and infra). You can re-use
  the tests in the springboot deployment, it uses RestAssured which should
  be framework agnostic.
